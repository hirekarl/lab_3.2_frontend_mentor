### Scenario
In a professional setting, developers often work from detailed Figma designs to build high-quality, pixel-perfect web components. To strengthen your development skills, this lab will introduce you to Frontend Mentor, a tool providing real-world coding challenges. Frontend Mentor will help you practice translating Figma designs into HTML and CSS and give you a taste of professional front-end development workflows. The hands-on challenges will enhance your proficiency with core web development tools and refine your ability to implement design specifications accurately.

### Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Create an account and navigate the Frontend Mentor platform.
- Complete two foundational Frontend Mentor challenges using HTML and CSS.
- Optionally complete additional challenges to build more complex web components.
